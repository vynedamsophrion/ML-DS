Day 4: Deep Learning – CNN on MNIST

Tasks Completed:
1. Loaded and preprocessed the MNIST handwritten digits dataset (60,000 training + 10,000 test images).
2. Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras.
3. Defined a model with:
   - 3 convolutional layers (32, 64, 64 filters)
   - MaxPooling layers for feature reduction
   - Flatten + Dense layers for final classification
4. Compiled and trained the model for 5 epochs using the Adam optimizer.
5. Achieved a test accuracy of ~99.02%, showing strong generalization.
6. Visualized:
   - Training vs validation accuracy/loss curves
   - Predicted vs actual digits from test samples

Key Takeaways:
- CNNs excel at image recognition tasks due to their ability to automatically extract spatial features.
- Normalizing pixel values improves convergence speed.
- More filters and deeper layers can improve accuracy—but may increase training time.

Conclusion:
The CNN model efficiently learned to recognize handwritten digits with over 99% accuracy.
This demonstrates the strength of convolutional layers in extracting meaningful visual patterns from image data.
