Unsupervised Learning – Concept Overview

Unsupervised Learning is a type of machine learning where the model is not given labeled data. Instead, it tries to find hidden structures, patterns, or relationships within the data on its own.

Unlike supervised learning, where the goal is to predict a known output (like class labels), unsupervised learning focuses on understanding the underlying distribution of the data.

There are two major types of unsupervised learning techniques:
1. **Clustering** – grouping similar data points together based on similarity or distance metrics (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN).
2. **Dimensionality Reduction** – reducing the number of features while preserving important information (e.g., PCA, t-SNE).

Applications include:
- Customer segmentation in marketing
- Anomaly detection in cybersecurity and finance
- Image compression
- Document or topic grouping (NLP)

**K-Means Clustering**
K-Means is a simple and efficient clustering algorithm that partitions data into *k* clusters. It works by minimizing the variance within each cluster.

Algorithm Steps:
1. Choose *k* (number of clusters).
2. Randomly initialize *k* centroids.
3. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.
4. Recompute centroids as the mean of assigned points.
5. Repeat steps 3–4 until convergence (centroids stop changing).

The **Elbow Method** helps determine the optimal *k* by plotting the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) against different *k* values and finding the "elbow" point.

Advantages:
- Easy to understand and implement.
- Scales well to large datasets.

Limitations:
- Must predefine *k*.
- Sensitive to outliers and initial centroid placement.

In summary, unsupervised learning enables data-driven pattern discovery without labeled outcomes, forming the foundation for exploratory data analysis and many AI applications.
