# Supervised Learning

Supervised Learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data â€” data that already contains input-output pairs. The goal is to learn a mapping function from inputs (X) to outputs (Y). There are two main types:
- **Regression:** Predicting continuous values (e.g., house prices, temperature).
- **Classification:** Predicting discrete labels (e.g., spam/not spam, disease detection).

The process involves splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, training a model on known outputs, and then evaluating its performance on unseen data. Common algorithms include Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

### Reflection
From this project, I learned how supervised learning uses real labeled data to teach a model to predict outcomes. The challenge was ensuring clean data preprocessing and choosing the right evaluation metrics to verify model accuracy.
