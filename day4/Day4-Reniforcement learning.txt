Reinforcement Learning:-

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns by interacting with an environment to achieve a specific goal. Unlike supervised learning, which learns from labeled examples, RL learns from experience — the agent tries actions, observes outcomes, and receives rewards or penalties based on performance.

The RL process follows a loop involving:

State (S): The current situation or environment status.

Action (A): The decision taken by the agent.

Reward (R): The feedback received from the environment.

Policy (π): A strategy that defines how the agent chooses actions based on states.

Over time, the agent improves its policy to maximize cumulative rewards.
Popular algorithms include Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), and Policy Gradient Methods.

Reinforcement Learning powers applications such as robotics, self-driving cars, game-playing AI (like AlphaGo), and recommendation systems.
It teaches machines to learn optimal actions — similar to how humans learn from experience and feedback.

Generative Adversarial Networks:-

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a special class of Generative Models that can learn to produce new data samples similar to the original dataset.
A GAN consists of two neural networks that compete against each other:

Generator (G): Creates fake data (for example, fake handwritten digits).

Discriminator (D): Evaluates whether the input data is real or fake.

The training process is adversarial —

The Generator improves to fool the Discriminator.

The Discriminator improves to detect fake data.

Through this competition, both networks improve, and the Generator eventually produces realistic samples.
GANs are used for image generation, data augmentation, art creation, deepfake generation, and creative AI applications.

In this project, a simple GAN trained on the MNIST dataset was implemented using PyTorch.
It learned to generate new handwritten digits similar to the original dataset — demonstrating how neural networks can create new data, not just classify or predict it.



Reflection:-
This project helped me clearly understand how reinforcement learning focuses on learning from feedback, while generative models focus on learning to create new data.
Building a GAN using PyTorch gave me practical experience in adversarial training and the roles of the generator and discriminator.
The most challenging part was stabilizing the training and balancing both model losses.
Watching the generator improve and produce realistic handwritten digits over epochs was very motivating.
This experiment strengthened my understanding of deep learning and showed me how creative and powerful neural networks can be when applied to real-world data generation tasks.
